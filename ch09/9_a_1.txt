-- Is the order in which we call bracket and handle important? Why?

-- The assignment is not completely clear. The 'bracket' function has three
-- actions. It's not clear what the order means here. When changing the order of
-- the 'bracket' and 'handle', 'handle' can be used in just one action or in
-- more of them.
--
-- Let's assume that changing the order means moving the 'handle' call to the
-- "use" action of the 'bracket' so that it covers that whole action.

-- The order is important. When the order is changed (see the assumption above),
-- exceptions thrown in the "acquire" and "release" actions will not be caught
-- by the 'handle' function.
